# Craft of Data Visualisation with Python

Some examples of data visualisation made with powerful Python libraries are presented here, and further may serve as

Most of the topics presented below are covered by the exercises you can find in this repository.

- Storytelling with data: good and bad practices of data visualization
- Main Python libraries for plotting: matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh (and pandas to rule them all)
- Low dimensional representation of data using machine learning
- How to explain machine learning models using figures
- Visualization of time series, text and geospatial data
- Fighting challenges of big data visualization
